# Node Messenger

Adaltas [webtech course](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-2020-fall-webtech) project.

The goal of this project is to build a basic messaging web app.<br>
It leverages Node.js and React as well as complementary technologies such as unit testing with Mocha and Should.js, embeded storage with LevelDB, REST APIs, ...<br>
If we have time, we'll also play with GraphQL and Socket<span>.io.

You can find the project instructions here: [INSTRUCTIONS.md](../master/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Usage

_How to start and use the application, run the tests, ..._

1. **Clone this repository, from your local machine:**<br>

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benzinho75/node-messenger
   cd node-messenger
   ```

2. **Install [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/getting-started/):**<br>

   For example, on Ubuntu, from your project root directory:

   ```bash
   # Install Go
   apt install golang-go
   # Download Dex
   git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex
   # Build Dex
   cd dex
   make
   make examples
   ```

3. **Register your GitHub application, get the clientID and clientSecret from GitHub and report them to your Dex configuration:**<br>

   Go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new and enter the following:

   Homepage URL: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex<br>
   Authorization callback URL: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback<br>

   It should give you back your clientID and clientSecret and you can now modify the provided `./dex-config/config.yml` configuration to look like:

   ```yaml
   - type: github
     id: github
     name: GitHub
     config:
       clientID: xxxx98f1c26493dbxxxx
       clientSecret: xxxxxxxxx80e139441b637796b128d8xxxxxxxxx
       redirectURI: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback
   ```
   **Now place the dex-config folder inside your dex folder.**<br><br>
   You should have a structure like this: `dex/dex-config/config.yml`.<br>
   The frond-end application is already registered and CORS is activated.

4. **Now that Dex is built and configured, your can start the Dex server:**<br>

   ```bash
   cd dex
   bin/dex serve dex-config/config.yaml
   ```

5. **Start the back-end:**<br>

   ```bash
   # In another terminal tab:
   cd back-end
   # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
   yarn install
   # Start the back-end
   bin/start
   ```

6. **Start the front-end:**<br>
   ```bash
   # In a third terminal tab:
   cd front-end
   # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
   yarn install
   # Start the front-end
   yarn start
   ```

### Application development

- Welcome screens

  - Customized login screen
  - Worked on looks

- Invite users to channels

  - Inviting known or new users at channel creation
  - Inviting users inside a channel (had to configure CORS preflight requests handling server side for PUT requests)

- Message modification

  - **MISSING:** The author of a message is able to modify its content

- Message removal

  - **MISSING:** The author of a message is able to remove it
